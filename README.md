This design is a virtual dashboard for a car.
There is a speedometer gauge for monitoring the speed. The speed range for the car is 0-220 km/h. Also there is an input bar which takes input of maximum 3 digits and when 'Enter' is pressed or the 'Accelerator' button is clicked, the speed is rendered on the speedometer gauge in real time. A background has been added of a car dashboard in the background.

The speedometer has speeds 180-200 km/h as yellow marked and 200-220 km/h as red. There are 10 minor ticks and 5 major ticks on the gauge dial. Whenever speed is in yellow zone, there is a beep and there are two beeps when speed is in red zone. The speed limits have been monitored --> Speeds less than zero or greater than 220 are reported as invalid.

This webpage is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, Bootstrap is used for decoration of button and input area and Google Gauge Charts Visualization is used for Speedometer Gauge.
